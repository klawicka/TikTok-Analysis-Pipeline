# TikTok-Analysis-Pipeline
Pipeline for analyzing TikTok results from user data output

The image below shows a pipeline I used for analyzing user data  (mine were coming from Poland and the Netherlands). I collected it using an app that anonymized the data. Assuming that you have a json file from a TikTok user data request, this repository will guide you through Step 2 - Data Analysis.
